# 🌼 Personal Portfolio Website 🌼

This repository holds the source code for my personal portfolio website, crafted to showcase my work and skills. It draws inspiration from a specific design.

## Overview 🚀

This project is a personal portfolio site that will eventually display my information, skills, and projects. Although I currently don't have projects to show or extensive knowledge of programming languages, I've created this webpage as a foundation that I can later customize with my own content and projects.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
